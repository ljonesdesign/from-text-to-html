<h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Home Page</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am a junior student at University of North Carolina, due
to graduate in May 2018.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a photo of me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Various jobs and on-campus activities have led me to be more
open-minded and welcome more opportunities in life. If you want to know more
about my professional life, here is a link to my resume.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am originally from Seattle, Washington where I was born
and raised. I have always been interested in cities and how they are planned
and designed. Through the Environmental Science BS, Quantitative Energy Systems
track major I have been able to concentrate in smart cities, and I hope to get
into urban planning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>My Interests</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although I love education and improving my mind in class, I
also manage to stay occupied during my free time. I am in the marching band at
UNC, which takes up most of my evenings during the week. I also enjoy yoga and
try to do it as much as possible, but it has been difficult to maintain a
schedule for that while at school this year. Spending time with my dog is my
favorite way to pass time. She is a lab mix and she loves to catch frisbees.
You can see her leaping to catch a disc to the <b>right</b>! I also love
reading. <b>Below</b> you can find a list of some of my favorite literature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Ten Cultural Works that have Most Influenced my Life</h3>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Grendel</i> by John Gardner </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed
     with Our Families</i> by Philip Gourevitch </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Heads, You Lose, and Other Apocryphal Tales</i> by
     Francis Greig </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>The Great Gatsby</i> by F. Scott Fitzgerald </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Angels and Demons</i> by Dan Brown</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Fahrenheit 451</i> by Ray Bradbury </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Of Mice and Men</i> by John Steinbeck </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>The Outsiders</i> by S.E. Hinton </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>1984</i> by George Orwell</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</i> by Richard Bach</li>
</ol>

<h2>My Classes</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SPAN 300</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>SPAN 300 is a review of Spanish grammar and composition. I
feel like this class has really helped me improve my grammatical and
conversational skills. This class is very heavily based in group work, which I
like a lot because it provides an opportunity to work on speaking skills. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>PHIL 105 </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A course on how to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments
by other people and how to construct arguments. Topics include argument
reconstruction, informal logic, fallacies, introductory formal logic, and
probabilistic reasoning. I am taking this course online as a general education
fulfillment. The course builds up my basic logic ideas, so I found it not only
interesting but also meaningful.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>INLS 161</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>INLS161 focuses on concepts and tools necessary for
communicating information to users. This is a critical component of information
literacy, which involves seeking, evaluating, and utilizing information. <br>
The course introduces some basic technology tools as an essential component of
information literacy training. </p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h2>Econ 125</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This class has been very interesting. The idea of the course
is to inspire and change the entrepeneurial mindset and show that there is a
creative process to it. We have guest speakers come in most days to talk about
their projects and give us ideas of our own. The other time is spent working
without teams to come up with a product in the area of media and journalism. It
has really shifted the way I perceive a business and how it operates. </p>
